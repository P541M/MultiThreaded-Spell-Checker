Generating randum paragraphs can be an excellent way for writters to get their creative flow going at the begining of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the randum paragraph will be about when it apears. This forces the writter to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challanges. The writter can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the randum paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the randum paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challanges is undertaken, the writter is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
